# 📌 Global Terrorism Data Analysis  

## 🌍 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **global terrorism trends** using **machine learning and data visualization**. By exploring historical attack patterns, affected regions, and attack methodologies, we derive **actionable insights** into terrorism activities worldwide.  

## 📊 Dataset Description  
**Datasets Used:**  
- `terrorism_dataset.csv` – Raw dataset containing detailed records of global terrorist incidents.  
- `cleaned_terrorism_data.csv` – Processed dataset after data cleaning and transformation.  

### **Dataset Features:**  
- ** Date & Location:** Country, city, and region of attacks.  
- ** Attack Characteristics:** Attack type, weapons used, target type.  
- ** Casualties & Damage:** Number of fatalities, injuries, property loss.  
- ** Terrorist Groups:** Identification of responsible organizations.  
- **⚠ Additional Factors:** Ransom demands, hostages, and other influencing variables.
